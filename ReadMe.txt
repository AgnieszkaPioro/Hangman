Hi,

Two months ago (after 8 years of working as a customer service group manager) I decided to completely change my current industry and job.

I started learning programming a few weeks ago so I'm a very beginner. This was my first experience working in C #. I am currently doing a course (automation tester) in one of the coding schools. I've always wanted to learn programming and I think it's never too late to decide.

I like learning new things, I enjoy learning programming, but I know that I have a long way to go. I am strongly motivated to take up my first job in the IT industry in the future.

Greetings
Agnieszka Pióro
